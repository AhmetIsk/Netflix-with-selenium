# Netflix clone

This is CS 458 Software Verification and Validation course project 1.
For the project, Netflix sign in page is cloned and login operation is conducted and tested using Selenium.

# Usage
Firstly, you need to install the dependencies required with pip, in order to do that, fire up a terminal and "cd" into the project folder, and write "pip install -r requirements.txt". Addition to those dependencies, "chromedriver" is need for Selenium to be run, to do that, if you are a Mac user, open up a terminal and type "brew install chrome driver". 

If you use Windows, you need to download ChromeWeb Driver and place it in a constant folder in order to define PATH. PATH can be define from This PC > Right Click, Properties > Advanced System Settings > Advanced Tab, Environment Variables > Under System Variables, Path, Edit > New > Write/Paste path of the chromedriver. > Press Ok. After doing this you can run the test script when you are still under the project folder, by writing to your terminal, "python test_cases/test_cases.py".
